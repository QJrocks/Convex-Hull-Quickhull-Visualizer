Convex Hull Quickhull Visualizer

This program implements the Quickhull algorithm for finding a minimal set of lines that bounds a set of points.

It also includes a SFML-powered visualizer (https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) to show the process step-by-step.
(The program can be built without the visualizer if you don't with to set up SFML, in which case it merely produces the list of points.)

The program is well-commented, so do take a look at quickhull.cpp for more instructions on running the program!
